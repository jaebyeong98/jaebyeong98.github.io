  I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://ml.yonsei.ac.kr/">Yonsei University Machine Learning Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/kibok90/">Kibok Lee</a>. My research is broadly in machine learning and computer vision, with a particular focus on deep representation learning. Recently, I have become especially interested in compositional reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs).
